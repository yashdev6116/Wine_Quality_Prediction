Wine Quality Prediction:

Problem Statement:
There is a wine manufacturing company and that company wants to create a new brand of wine, So me as a data scientist, my work is to make a model which can find the quality of the wine using a dataset consist of columns which defines chemical used in it.

My Work:
I will be building a ML predictive model that can take all the values(chemical values for the dataset)and tell us that the quality of the wine is good or bad.

Work-Flow:
1. DataSet- Labelled Dataset(Supervised Learning) // Red wine Quality // Kaggle
2. EDA / Data Analysis
3. Data Pre-processing
4. Train-Test split
5. Random Forest Model - Supervised Learning Model.
6. Trained Randon Forest Model - Once the model is trained in the given data.
7. Testing
8. Result
